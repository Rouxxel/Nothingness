 I try to improve the player movement and obstacle spawning

It was supposed to be a project to improve the movement of the player object and obstacle spawning but the project went a little too far in the sense that more logic was implemented than just that. 

i tried the implementation of a very simple and cranky buff-debuff system that barely holds itself together, a movement system that includes not only movement in X and Y axis but also a combination of both at the same time for diagonal movement, for the spawners i tried to implement a decrease system so they would spawn objects more often as time goes on, added animation to all sprites for gameobjects and tried to implement several scenes for different points of the game but failed miserably and scrapped the idea itself.

Overall i feel an improvement but still, the playerscript has too many things and too many other scripts depend on it
